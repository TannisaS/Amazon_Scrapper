   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```
4. **Update the ChromeDriver path in the script (setup_driver() function)**.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:

   python best_seller.py
   ```
## Configuration

### Categories
- Update the `categories` list in the script with the URLs and names of the Best Sellers categories you want to scrape.

### Example:
```python
categories = [
    {
        "name": "Books",
        "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Books/zgbs/books"
    },
    {
        "name": "Electronics",
        "url": "https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Electronics/zgbs/electronics"
    }
]
```
## Output

The script generates a CSV file (`amazon_best_sellers.csv`) with the following columns:

- **Product Name**
- **Price**
- **Discount**
- **Rating**
- **Category**
- **Seller**
- **Description**

## Limitations

- **CAPTCHAs**:  
  Manual intervention may be required to solve CAPTCHAs during login.

- **Dynamic Content**:  
  Some fields (e.g., "Ship From," "Sold By") require additional navigation to the product detail pages.

- **Compliance**:  
  Ensure that the scraping adheres to Amazonâ€™s [Terms of Service](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html).

## Future Enhancements

- **CAPTCHA Handling**:  
  Add support for CAPTCHA-solving tools.

- **Detailed Product Information**:  
  Navigate to product pages to scrape additional details such as "Ship From," "Sold By," and product images.

- **Multi-Browser Support**:  
  Add support for Firefox, Edge, or other browsers.
